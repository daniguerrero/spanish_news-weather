alarm_podcast.py is a script that helps me not to spend too much time during the morning checking usual things.

The script basically do 3 things:
1.- Connects to Yahoo weather to parse the current weather conditions and the forecast.
2.- All that information is sent to festival, who is doing the text to speech conversion and output to the speakers.
3.- Finally the scripts check the national spanish televesion for a 2 minutes news video, that downloads, trying to bypass
some obfuscation. Then the video is played with the realtime weather information, an icon showing the weather and also the time.

A cron job is in charge of running it daily from Mon to Fri. Using a bash script that is doing something like:

#!/bin/bash
pushd .
cd /home/user/weather
#lets clean the house first
find *.flv *.png -type f -mtime +3 -exec rm {} \;
python alarm_podcast.py
popd .
