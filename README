#    alarm_podcast.py is a script that helps me not to spend too much time during the morning checking usual things.

#    The script basically do 3 things:
#    1.- Connects to Yahoo weather to parse the current weather conditions and the forecast.
#    2.- All that information is sent to festival, who is doing the text to speech conversion and output to the
#        speakers.
#    3.- Finally the scripts check the national spanish television for a 2 minutes news video, that downloads, trying to #        bypass some obfuscation. Then the video is played with the realtime weather information, an icon showing the
#        weather and also the time.

#    A cron job is in charge of running it daily from Mon to Fri. Using a bash script that is doing something like:
#    #!/bin/bash
#    pushd .
#    cd /home/user/weather
#    lets clean the house first
#    find *.flv *.png -type f -mtime +3 -exec rm {} \;
#    python alarm_podcast.py
#    popd .
